# Why should I test it?

# Everyone was a Junior once...

---

# Why should I test it?

---

# Because I told you to.

---

# Not anymore!

---

# There are 4 main reasons to create tests

---

# 1- Someone else will touch that code

---

# 2- You may have to add a functionality

---

# 3- You'll be able to refactor with confidence

---

# 4- You don't want to receive calls at 3AM

---

# Imagine a counter

`- 0 +`

---

# What should you test?

---

# Why?

---

```js
describe("Counter", () => {
    it("Should start with 0", () => {
        ...
    })
    it("Should increase value when '+' is clicked", () => {
        ...
    })
    it("Should decrease value when '-' is clicked", () => {
        ...
    })
})
```

# Found an edge case? Test it!

---

# Component -> Unit test

---

# Function -> Unit test

---

# Page -> E2E test

---

# Testing Library
